## Parisian Enchantment

**Logline:** An ambitious American marketing executive finds herself caught in a whirlwind of career challenges, romantic entanglements, and cultural clashes in the enchanting city of Paris, where the lines between ambition, friendship, and love blur under the Eiffel Tower's shadow.

**Characters:**

* **EMILY COOPER:** 29, American, bubbly, driven, sometimes culturally clueless but always optimistic. 
* **GABRIEL:** 32, French, charming, talented chef, kind, carries a hint of melancholy.
* **CAMILLE:** 28, French, sophisticated, elegant, Gabriel's ex-girlfriend, becomes Emily's friend.

**Scene 1:**

**INT. SAVOIR OFFICE - DAY**

Sunlight streams through the Parisian windows. Emily, dressed impeccably but slightly out of place, stands before SYLVIE, her French boss, 40s, chic, intimidating.

SYLVIE
(With a thick French accent)
So, Mademoiselle Cooper, you think you can teach us about marketing?

EMILY
(Smiling brightly)
I'm here to offer an American perspective, a fresh take.  I think we can achieve great things together.

Sylvie raises a perfectly sculpted eyebrow.

SYLVIE
"Great things"?  We'll see.  Your first task:  Make our champagne client relevant to millennials. They think it's their grandmother's drink.

**Scene 5:**

**INT. GABRIEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Emily, clutching a bottle of wine, knocks on Gabriel's door. He opens it, a flour smudge on his cheek.

EMILY
Sorry to bother you, but my corkscrew broke.  Catastrophe, right?

GABRIEL
(Chuckles)
A true Parisian tragedy. Come in.


**Scene 10:**

**EXT. STREET MARKET - DAY**

Emily and Camille stroll through a bustling market.

CAMILLE
Gabriel is a wonderful chef.  He's been dreaming of his own restaurant for years.

EMILY
(Trying to sound casual)
He seems… passionate.

CAMILLE
We were together for a long time.  It's complicated.

Emily's forced smile falters.

**Scene 20:**

**INT. SAVOIR OFFICE - DAY**

Sylvie stares at Emily's phone, where a photo of a pain au chocolat is captioned “Butter me up, Paris!”

SYLVIE
(Exasperated)
This is not marketing. This is… juvenile.

EMILY
But engagement is up!  People love it!

SYLVIE
They love to laugh *at* you, Mademoiselle Cooper.


**Scene 30:**

**INT. GABRIEL'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT**

Emily and Gabriel sit at a table after closing.  The air crackles with unspoken tension.

GABRIEL
You know, Emily, you're not so bad for an American.

EMILY
(Laughing)
And you're not so bad for a… a… what do Americans call French guys?  Dreamy?

He leans closer.  Their hands brush.


**Scene 40:**

**EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT**

Camille, unaware of Emily's growing feelings for Gabriel, confides in her.

CAMILLE
I think I might try to win Gabriel back.

Emily’s heart sinks.

EMILY
(Quietly)
Oh.


**(Climax)**

**Scene 45:**

**INT. GABRIEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Emily and Gabriel kiss passionately.  Suddenly, Camille enters, seeing everything.  


**Ending 1: The American Dream**

Emily chooses her career over Gabriel. She excels at Savoir, embracing the Parisian lifestyle on her own terms.  She becomes a successful, independent woman, occasionally reminiscing about the chef downstairs.

**Ending 2: Parisian Romance**

Emily and Gabriel admit their feelings, despite the hurt caused to Camille.  They navigate the complexities of their relationship, embracing the challenges and the joys of love in the City of Lights. Camille, heartbroken, eventually finds happiness elsewhere.

**Ending 3: The Unexpected Return**

Emily, torn between Gabriel and her career, decides to return to Chicago.  At the airport, Gabriel arrives, confessing his love and begging her to stay. Emily, faced with a life-altering decision, looks at the departing plane and then back at Gabriel.  The screen fades to black.
