## The Weaver's Knot

**Logline:** A weaver, haunted by a past love, must choose between his quiet solitude and the chance to reconnect with the world he left behind.

**Characters:**

* **ABHINAYA (30s):** A strong, independent woman. Runs a small tea stall near the river. Carries a quiet sadness, but possesses a resilient spirit.
* **ANJAN (30s):** A skilled weaver, living a solitary life.  Haunted by guilt and regret, he finds solace only in his craft.
* **PRANAV (60s):** A kind, elderly boatman.  Acts as a bridge between Abhinaya and Anjan, carrying unspoken messages between them.

**Scene 1:**

**INT. ANJAN'S HUT - DAY**

Sunlight filters through the cracks in the wooden walls of Anjan's small hut.  Dust motes dance in the beams. Anjan sits at his loom, his hands moving with practiced precision, weaving intricate patterns into a vibrant cloth. His face is etched with weariness.


**Scene 2:**

**EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY**

Abhinaya serves tea to Pranav from her small stall.  The river flows gently beside them.

**ABHINAYA**
The monsoon will arrive soon.  The river will swell.

**PRANAV**
(Sipping his tea)
Yes. Change is inevitable. Like the tides. Like the patterns in Anjan's cloth.

Abhinaya looks towards Anjan's hut, a flicker of sadness in her eyes.


**Scene 3:**

**INT. ANJAN'S HUT - NIGHT**

Anjan works late into the night, the only light coming from a flickering oil lamp. He stops weaving, picks up a small, faded photograph of himself, Abhinaya and a young child, his expression filled with pain.


**Scene 4:**

**EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY**

Pranav hands Abhinaya a small, intricately woven cloth.

**PRANAV**
A gift. From Anjan.

Abhinaya runs her fingers over the cloth, her eyes welling up.


**Scene 5:**

**EXT. RIVERBANK - SUNSET**

Anjan stands hesitantly by the riverbank, watching Abhinaya at her stall. She looks up, their eyes meet across the distance. 

**Ending 1 (Hopeful):**

Abhinaya slowly walks towards Anjan. He takes a step forward.  Pranav smiles, watching them from his boat.  The setting sun casts a warm glow on their faces.


**Ending 2 (Bittersweet):**

Abhinaya holds the woven cloth close to her chest, then turns away from Anjan, returning to her stall. Anjan watches her go, his face a mask of despair. He retreats back to his hut.


**Ending 3 (Ambiguous):**

Anjan and Abhinaya continue to stare at each other across the river, the distance between them unchanged. The sun sets, leaving them shrouded in twilight. Pranav gently rows his boat downstream, leaving them alone. The woven cloth flutters in the evening breeze.
