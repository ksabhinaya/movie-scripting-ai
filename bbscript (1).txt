Beauty and the Beast – Mini Script
By Adityan

FADE IN.

EXT. ENCHANTED CASTLE – NIGHT

A grand, mystical castle stands under the moonlight, its towers piercing the stormy sky. BELLE, a courageous young woman, stands before the BEAST, who watches her with sorrowful eyes. The enchanted rose glows faintly in the background.

INT. CASTLE LIBRARY – NIGHT

BELLE wanders through towering bookshelves, running her fingers over the leather-bound spines.

BEAST
(awkwardly clearing his throat)
I... thought you might like it here.

BELLE
(eyes wide in awe, whispering)
This is... incredible.

BEAST
(softly)
Then it’s yours.

Belle turns, surprised. The Beast looks away, embarrassed.

BELLE
You’re not as terrible as I first thought.

A small smile tugs at the Beast’s lips before he quickly hides it.

EXT. CASTLE BALCONY – NIGHT

Snow falls gently. Belle and the Beast stand together, watching the stars. There’s an unspoken warmth between them.

BELLE
Why were you cursed?

BEAST
Because I was selfish… cruel. I had everything, yet I cared for nothing.

BELLE
And now?

The Beast looks at her, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

BEAST
Now, I care for something.

Belle smiles. The last petal of the enchanted rose trembles, not yet ready to fall.

FADE OUT.
